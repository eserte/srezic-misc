<h1>Advanced listboxes with Tk::HList</h1>

The common listbox widget in Perl/Tk is handy in its usage, but
limited in its capabilities. There are many demands in the <tt><a
href="news:comp.lang.perl.tk">comp.lang.perl.tk</a></tt> newsgroup for
features like multiple columns or different display styles for listbox
items.

<p>

One answer to these questions is the <tt>Tk::HList</tt> widget.
<tt>HList</tt> is the hierarchical list widget of Perl/Tk. This widget
first appeared in Ioi Kim Lam's Tix widget set for Tcl/Tk and is part
of the Perl/Tk core.

<p>

Some features of <tt>HList</tt> are:
<ul>
 <li>hierarchical trees (this is not covered by this article)
 <li>multiple columns
 <li>headers
 <li>display items
 <li>extended binding options
 <li>associate data with list items
</ul>

<h2>Basic usage</h2>

The script <a href="basic.pl">basic.pl</a> shows a short example for
the usage of a <tt>HList</tt> widget. Note that you have to insert the
line <pre>    use&nbsp;Tk::HList;</pre> to use this widget. The creation
of a <tt>HList</tt> does not differ from other Perl/Tk widgets:
<pre>    $hl = $top->HList->pack;</pre>

<p>

<tt>HList</tt> entries are inserted with the <tt>add</tt> method. You
have to specify an entry path for each <tt>HList</tt> entry. Entry
paths are just unique names for each list item (the term "path" is
used because <tt>HList</tt> was designed to display trees like
directory structures). If you don't care, you can simply use a counter
for the entry path, like I did in the example. The sorting of the
entries is by default determined by the lexically order of the entry
paths. You can also use the options <tt>-at</tt>, <tt>-before</tt> or
<tt>after</tt> to set the position in another way. Here's an example:<p>

Add an entry with the string "Bla" and the entry path "bla" into the
<tt>HList</tt>:
<pre>    $hl->add("bla", -text => "Bla");</pre>
Add an entry with the string "Foo" before "bla":
<pre>    $hl->add("foo", -before => "bla", -text => "Foo");</pre>
Add an entry with the string "abc" after "bla":
<pre>    $hl->add("abc", -after => "bla", -text => "abc");</pre>
Add an entry at the the second position (indexes start at zero):
<pre>    $hl->add("def", -at => 1, -text => "def");</pre>

<p>

<h2>Multiple columns</h2>

<a name="fixedfont">With</a> the standard <tt>Listbox</tt> widget, one
could only create multiple columns by using a fixed font with fixed
record lengths for each listbox item.

<p>

With <tt>HList</tt>, you can supply the -columns option at the
creation of a HList to create a multi-column listbox. See the script
<a href="multicol.pl">multicol.pl</a> for an example.

<p>

In a multi-column <tt>HList</tt>, the <tt>add</tt> method will set the
first column of an entry. The other columns are created with the
<tt>itemCreate</tt> method:

<pre>$hl->itemCreate($entry, $column, -text => $text);</pre>

The column indexing starts at zero. It's also possible to use the
<tt>itemCreate</tt> method to set the first column instead of the
<tt>add</tt> method (which would be a more orthogonal approach).

<h2>List headers</h2>

When using multiple columns, it would be nice to have headers for these
columns. It is possible to use the first row as the header, but if you
have a scrolled <tt>HList</tt>, this row could go out of sight. So
it's better to configure <tt>HList</tt> to use real headers. At
creation time, add this line to enable headers: <pre>-header => 1</pre>

<p>

The header items are created with the <tt>headerCreate</tt> method.
The syntax is similar to the <tt>itemCreate</tt> method, except that
there is no <tt>$entry</tt> argument. Here's an example script (<a
href="header.pl">header.pl</a>).

<p>

<h2>Various styles</h2>

You are not limited to only display text in a <tt>HList</tt>. The
option <tt><a name="itemstyle">-itemtype</a></tt> controls, whether
images and/or text should be displayed. The allowed values are
<tt>text</tt> (default), <tt>image</tt>, <tt>imagetext</tt>, to
display text and an image to the left, and <tt>window</tt>, to display
arbitrary widgets. For an example using images and texts, look at the
script <a href="imagetext.pl">imagetext.pl</a>.

<p>
<img src="imagetext.png">
<p>

Moreover, you can assign individual styles to each <tt>HList</tt>
item. This is done using the Tix concept <b>Display Items</b>. There is
a manpage <b>Tk::DItem</b> describing this concept and providing
examples. 

<p>

For using display items, first include the <tt>ItemStyle</tt> module:
<pre>    use Tk::ItemStyle;</pre>

After that you can create new styles. Styles can be used by more than
one item, so create equal styles only once.
<pre>
    $style = $hl->ItemStyle("text",
                            -foreground => "red",
                            -background => "green",
                            -font => "Times 24");
</pre>
The first argument (here: "text") specifies the validity of the style
definition,
which have to match the <a href="#itemstyle">itemstyle</a> defintion.
To use this style, supply the <tt>-style</tt> option to an <tt>add</tt> or
<tt>itemCreate</tt> method:
<pre>
    $hl->add("foo", -style => $style, -text => "Text");
</pre>
Or to re-configure an existing <tt>HList</tt> item:
<pre>
    $l->itemConfigure("foo", 0, -style => $style);
</pre>

Some further examples can be found in <a href="ditem.pl">ditem.pl</a>.

<h2>Other conveniences</h2>
With the standard listbox widget, mouse and key bindings have to be
defined with the <tt>bind</tt> method. <tt>HList</tt> has two
parameters <tt>-browsecmd</tt> and <tt>-command</tt>, which simplify
the addition of callbacks. Both options accept a standard Perl/Tk
callback (e.g. an anonymous subroutine) as its parameters. The
<tt>-command</tt> callback will be called if the user double-clicks on
an entry. The <tt>-browsecmd</tt> callback will be called if the user
"browses" through the list, that is, either single clicks on a list
entry or moves the anchor with the arrow keys. The complete binding
description can be found at the <tt>Tk::HList</tt> manpage.

<p>

With the <tt>-data</tt> option, it is possible to bind data to list
entries. The data argument can be any perl scalar, so array and hash
references are allowed, too. Data can be retrieved with the
<tt>info("data")</tt> method:
<pre>
    $hl = $top->HList->pack;
    # Set entry and data
    $hl->add("abc",
             -text => "An entry",
             -data => ["associated", "data"],
            );
    # Retrieve data
    use Data::Dumper;
    print Data::Dumper->Dump([$hl->info("data", "abc")], ['data']), "\n";
</pre>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

There are some other alternatives to get similar functionality of
<tt>Hlist</tt>'s. If you don't mind the appearance, for multiple
columns one can use the fixed-font approach described <a
href="fixedfont">above</a>. Another method is to use a <tt>Text</tt>
widget with the <tt>-tabs</tt> option. This option sets tabular stops
which can be used to define multiple columns. The example below will
set two tab stops at 2cm and 4cm:
<pre>
    use Tk;
    $top = new MainWindow;
    $txt = $top->Text(-tabs => [qw/2c 4c/])->pack;
    $txt->insert("end",
                 "X\tY\tX*Y\n" .
                 "1\t1\t1\n" .
                 "2\t2\t4\n" .
                 "3\t3\t9\n" .
                 "4\t4\t16\n");
    MainLoop;
</pre>
If you are familiar wih <tt>Text</tt> widgets, this could be the way to
go. The common <tt>Text</tt> tag mechanisms are available for
representing different styles.

<p>

The <tt>Tk::TiedListbox</tt> by Andrew Allen (at CPAN in the <a
href="ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/perl/CPAN/authors/id/ACH/Tk-Contrib-0.07.tar.gz">Tk-Contrib</a>
distribution) provides a way to tie the scrolling of two or more
listboxes. That way multi-column listboxes can be emulated by placing
several <tt>TiedListbox</tt>es side by side.

<p>

There is another module which appeared in the perl/Tk mailinglist by
Greg London called <tt>TextList</tt>. This module emulates the
<tt>Tk::Listbox</tt> behaviour with a <tt>Text</tt> widget. That is,
all method calls are the same as in <tt>Tk::Listbox</tt>, but the user
can additionaly use the tag mechanism of <tt>Text</tt> widgets.

<p>

Damion K. Wilson has contributed another multi-column listbox in his 
<a
href="ftp://ftp.cpan.org:/pub/perl/CPAN/authors/id/D/DK/DKWILSON">Tk-DKW</a>
package, called <tt>Tk::Columns</tt>. Additional features are headers and
resizable column width (with the technique used for instance in the
Netscape mail program). By clicking a header, the listbox gets sorted
by this column. The API is simpler than that of <tt>HList</tt>: for
inserting a row with three columns one would simply write:
<pre>    $Columns->insert ('end', 'List', 'Row', 'Contents');</pre>

Here's a screenshot of a <tt>Tk::Columns</tt> demonstration script:

<p>

That's all! As you see, there is always a great variety to achieve a
goal with Perl/Tk.

<h1>Drag and drop with Perl/Tk</h1>

A useful interface for communication between GUI programs is the
<i>drag and drop</i> facility. This interface can also be used for
actions inside an application, e.g. for moving items from one place to
another. Perl/Tk supports drag and drop, and since the documentation
in the distribution is a little sparse on this topic, I will provide
some information in this article.

<p>

A user who wants to implement drag and drop in his Perl/Tk application
has to deal with the following concepts:
<ul>
<li>The drag source: the widget where a drag action starts (by
pressing the mouse button on the item to be moved and moving the
mouse).

<li>The drag token: this is a widget, which is moved by the
mouse cursor from one location to another. This can be a label with
text or an image.

<li>The dropsite: this is a widget in the GUI which will accept drops.
</ul>

<p>

In Perl/Tk, two types of drag and drops are implemented: local drops
and drops from other applications. Local drops work on all supported
platforms. Drops between applications are not standardized, so there
is a number of drag and drop protocols. Perl/Tk supports these
protocols: <i>Sun</i>, <i>XDND</i>, <i>KDE</i> and <i>Win32</i>. The
Sun protocol is supported since the old 400.xxx days. Win32 support is
added in the version 800.005, while the KDE and XDND support is fairly
new: they appeared in the latest 800.015 release. KDE drag and drop is
used by the KDE file manager <i>kfm</i>. XDND is a protocol developed
by <a href="mailto:jafl@alice.wonderland.caltech.edu">John Lindal</a>
and is used in GNOME. It is expected that KDE will also switch to XDND
in the future.

<p>

The drag and drop interface is fairly low-level, as it works using X11
selections. There are some limitations (the interface only works for
single files and does not support anything else than filenames, that
is, drops using URLs in KDE will not work). There is also rumor that
there will be changes in the Tcl/Tk core to support drag and drop, so
it is likely that this changes will appear some day in Perl/Tk, too.
Nevertheless, the current interface in Perl/Tk is working and useful.

<h2>Local drops</h2> <img src="localdnd.png"><p> Here is a <a
href="localdnd.pl">sample script</a> for local drag and drop. In this
example two listboxes are created. Items from the left listbox can be
dragged to the left one.

<p>
For local drops we need either the source and the target side, so both
drag and drop modules should be included in the script:
<tt>Tk::DragDrop</tt> (for the source) and <tt>Tk::DropSite</tt> (for
the target). The source side is defined by calling the
<tt>DragDrop</tt> method on the source widget. The following options
should be set:
<ul>
<li><tt>-event</tt> for the event starting a drag action, usually
<tt>&lt;B1-Motion&gt;</tt>, meaning when pressing the left mouse
button and moving the cursor.
<li><tt>-sitetypes</tt> to specify the drag and drop protocol. As we use
local drops, we have to set this option to <tt>Local</tt>.
<li><tt>-startcommand</tt> specifies the callback which is executed
when starting a drag.
</ul>
The <tt>DragDrop</tt> method returns a "token", which is a
<tt>Label</tt> widget for the text or image displayed during the drag
action.

<p>
The target widget is called with the <tt>DropSite</tt> method. The
<tt>-droptypes</tt> option is used to register the drop type this
widget is accepting (here we use again <tt>Local</tt>) and the
<tt>-dropcommand</tt> option is set to a callback which is executed
when a drop occured.

<p>
In the example script, the <tt>StartDrag</tt> is called when a drag is
started. This subroutine is responsible for setting the content of the
drag token with the <tt>configure</tt> method. In the sample script,
the current item of the listbox is determined with the
<tt>nearest</tt> method. After that the token is placed at the current
cursor position and activated with <tt>raise</tt> and
<tt>deiconify</tt>. Further processing is done in the
<tt>FindSite</tt> method, which is responsible for highlighting the
token over a dropsite and to handle a drop action.

<p>
The <tt>Drop</tt> function of the example script accepts a drop and
performs an action. Here it uses the text value of the token to add
another item to the right listbox.


<h2>Remote drops</h2>

A <a href="extdnd.pl">sample script</a> for accepting drops from an
external application, e.g. the KDE file manager or the Windows
explorer.

<p>
For accepting drops from an external application, for example a file
manager, only a drop site has to be defined. So it's sufficient to
include only <tt>Tk::DropSite</tt>. The command to accept drops is the
same as in the example above for local drops. The list of drop types
should list all dnd protocols which should be accepted, that is Win32
if running on Windows, otherwise KDE, XDND and Sun.
<p>
The accepting callback receives an additional argument which is the
name of a selection. This selection is used to get the filename of the
drop. For Win32 dnd, we have to look at the "STRING" property, while
for all other protocols, the property name is "FILE_NAME". In case of
an error (because the property is not defined), the selection get is
done in an <tt>eval</tt> block.

<h2>Additional methods</h2>
For the source side, the following callbacks can be set:
<ul>
<li>-entercommand: Called if a dropsite is entered.
<li>-motioncommand: Called if the token is moved over a dropsite.
</ul>

<h2>Short summary</h2>

Here is a short summary for using the drag and drop methods:

<pre>
# load code for using the source side
use Tk::DragDrop;

# load code for using the target side
use Tk::DropSite;

# define the source side
$target->DropSite(-dropcommand => \&amp;drop_handler,
                  -droptypes   => ['KDE','XDND','Sun','Win32','Local'],
		 );

# define the target side
$source->DragDrop(-event => '&lt;B1-Motion&gt;',
                  -sitetypes   => ['KDE','XDND','Sun','Win32','Local'],
		  -startcommand => \&amp;drag_handler,
		  -entercommand => \&amp;enter_handler,
		  -motioncommand => \&amp;motion_handler,
                 );

# used in the drag_handler
$token->FindSite($xpos, $ypos, $event);

</pre>

More information can be found in the <tt>DragDrop</tt> directory in
the source distribution of Perl/Tk. There are some sample scripts:
<tt>local_test</tt>, <tt>motion_test</tt> and <tt>site_test</tt>. And
if there are still open questions: use the force, read the source!

<h1>Notes</h1>

<h2>DnD with Tk::HList</h2> (2002-02-20)

<p>Look at this <a href="hlistdnd.pl">sample script</a> for drag and
drop with <tt>Tk::HList</tt>. You have to set the <tt>-selectmode</tt> of the
HList to <tt>dragdrop</tt>. There are more complicated issues, like dealing
with trees or multiple columns.

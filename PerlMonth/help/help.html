<h1>Help!</h1>

Don't let the user alone with your Perl/Tk application. It's quite
easy to implement some help functions with existing modules. This
article will discuss three of them: <tt>Tk::Balloon</tt>,
<tt>Tk::Pod</tt> and <tt>Tk::ContextHelp</tt>.

<h2>Tk::Balloon</h2>

<p>

A familiar help facility in most Windows and Macintosh programs is the
"tool tips" window, or, in the terminology of Perl/Tk, the help
balloon. This is a small window with a help message popping up if the
user leaves the mouse cursor over a widget for a short time.
Additionally, if there is a status bar, the help message is also
displayed in it. The standard Perl/Tk module <tt>Tk::Balloon</tt>
provides this feature.

<p>

To use it, the balloon object first has to be created:
<pre>    $balloon = $top->Balloon(-statusbar => $status_bar_widget);
</pre>
This will create a hidden balloon, which is technically a borderless
toplevel widget (to get it borderless, the <tt>overrideredirect</tt>
method is used, see the <tt>Tk::Wm</tt> man page). The
<tt>-statusbar</tt> argument is optional. It can be set to a widget
object which understands the <tt>-text</tt> or <tt>-textvariable</tt>
option, like (typically) a <tt>Label</tt>, a <tt>Button</tt>, or a
<tt>Message</tt> widget.

<p>

Now, to associate a part of the GUI with a help message, we have to
use the attach method to the wanted widget:
<pre>    $balloon->attach($widget, -msg => "A help message");
</pre>
There are three types of message options. The <tt>-msg</tt> option
specifies the message for both the balloon and the status bar, and
with <tt>-balloonmsg</tt> and <tt>-statusmsg</tt> it is possible to
differentiate those messages.

<p>

For <tt>Canvas</tt> and <tt>Menu</tt> widgets, there is an additional
special mode. For a <tt>Canvas</tt> widget, it is possible to attach
messages to individual canvas items. For menus, each menu entry can
get an individual balloon message (note that probably this will <b>not</b>
work on Windows). To use this feature, the argument to <tt>-msg</tt>
should be a hash with the canvas item numbers or tag strings as the
keys and the messages as the values. For menus, the argument should be
an array with the first message attached to the first menu entry and
so on (however, keep in mind that the first menu entry is often the
tear-off entry). Examples for this usage can be found in the
SYNOPSIS section of the <tt>Tk::Balloon</tt> manual page.

<h2>The forgotten help menu</h2>

The last entry of a menu bar in a common gui application, is a help
menu. It's almost always there, but often there is not much
information in it. At least, there should be an "About" entry
providing copyright, version and author information. Better, if there
is an entry for the manual of the application.

<p>

You are programming in Perl, so there's a chance you are familiar with
the Pod documentation format. There is a number of Pod utilities
bundled with the core Perl, so there is always a chance to get the
documentation in a format you like.

<p>

To display Pod documentation, there are some naïve approaches:
<ul>
<li>Use a Tk::Text window with the output of <tt>pod2text</tt>
<li>Convert the Pod documentation to html (for example with the
<tt>pod2html</tt> utility) and display the html file with Netscape
(or lynx or w3m or kfm or chimera or mosaic...)
<li>There are a lot of other (external) help manual browsers, like
xman or tkman. 
</ul>

But I think a better way is to use the Perl/Tk module
<tt>Tk::Pod</tt>...

<h2>Tk::Pod</h2>

<tt>Tk::Pod</tt> is a Pod browser written in Perl/Tk. This module is
not in the standard Perl/Tk distribution. You have to fetch it from
the <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Tk">CPAN</a>.

<!-- <a
???>Here</a> are some instructions how to install modules from CPAN.-->

Look at a <a href="tkpod.png">screenshot</a> of a <tt>Tk::Pod</tt>
window.

<p>

<tt>Tk::Pod</tt> is in fact a hypertext browser. Links in the Pod
documentation (which are marked with <nobr><tt>L&lt; ...
&gt;</tt></nobr>) are functional: you can jump to references inside
the Pod and to other Pods.

<p>

You can search the document. Moreover, if <tt>Text::English</tt> is
installed and a fulltext index of the perl documentation is built,
a query over the whole installed perl documentation is possible.

<p>

Additionally, there is a menu displaying the structure of the
document, thus it's possible to jump quickly to different sections.

<p>

These features make <tt>Tk::Pod</tt> also a good choice for reading
perl documentation instead of <tt>man</tt> or <tt>perldoc</tt>.
Together with the module, the program <tt>tkpod</tt> is installed as a
standalone Pod viewer.

Here is an example for Pod use: this defines a menu entry for
the manual:

<pre>
use FindBin;
use Tk;
...

$help_menu->command
  (-label => "~Documentation",
   -command => sub {
       eval {
           require Tk::Pod;
           Tk::Pod->Dir($FindBin::RealBin);
           $top->Pod(-file => $FindBin::RealScript . ".pod",
                     -title => 'Documentation for this program');
       };
       if ($@) {
           my $r;
           my $doc_html = "$FindBin::RealBin/$FindBin::RealScript.html";
           my $url;
           if (defined $doc_html && -r $doc_html) {
               $url = "file:$doc_html";
	       system("netscape $url&");
           }
       }
   },
  );
</pre>

(A complete example script can be found <a href="tkpodex.pl">here</a>)<p>

For explanation: the <tt>FindBin</tt> module helps to find the current
position of the running script. <tt>$FindBin::RealBin</tt> will be set
to the directory of the running script (not the current working
directory!) and <tt>$FindBin::RealScript</tt> will contain the
basename of the running script. There are also versions of these
variables without the "Real", which will contain the values without
all links resolved. The code above assumes that the documentation is
in a separat file with the extension ".pod". Of course, the
documentation can also be embedded in the perl script.

<p>

The menu entry handler will first try to see if <tt>Tk::Pod</tt> is
installed. Therefore an <tt>eval</tt> block is put around the
<tt>require</tt> statement, to prevent any error messages. With
<tt>Tk::Pod->Dir</tt>, an additional search directory for Pods is set
to the directory containg the running script - assuming that the Pod
is in the same directory (otherwise, only <tt>$ENV{PATH}</tt> and
<tt>@INC</tt> is searched for Pods). Then a new Pod widget is created
with the contents of the appropriate Pod file (the <tt>-file</tt>
option).

<p>

In case that the <tt>Tk::Pod</tt> is not installed or there were other
errors in the processing, the program tries a fall back: it checks
whether there is a html documentation file in the same directory. If
there is one, then Netscape is called with this file. You can adjust
the <tt>system</tt> line to your liking, e.g. calling "xterm -e lynx
$url&" or "xterm -e w3m $url&" for your favorite text-oriented web
browser. Note that the "&" is necessary to prevent the blocking of the
Perl/Tk program; otherwise, it won't react to any user input unless
the web browser is shut down.

<h2>Tk::ContextHelp</h2>

The last module described in this article is somewhat like a
combination of the previous two. It can be used to attach widgets to
individual help messages, but it can also use <tt>Tk::Pod</tt> to
display the appropriate parts of the documentation. This help facility
is similar to the one in Windows 95: There is a context help button.
By clicking this button, the cursor changes and now displays a
question mark next to the arrow. If the user moves the mouse to a
widget without a context help entry, then the question mark is crossed
to show that there is no help for this topic available. Otherwise the
user can click on the widget and a <tt>Tk::Pod</tt> window will pop up
with the appropriate topic. In case <tt>Tk::Pod</tt> is not installed,
a <tt>Tk::Text</tt> widget will be shown instead with the output of
<tt>pod2text</tt>.

<p>

Although this is a Windows technique, this module will not work on
Windows. This is because <tt>Tk::ContextHelp</tt> uses the
<tt>Tk::InputO</tt> widget, which is only available for the X11
version of Perl/Tk.

<p>

The coding is similar as in <tt>Tk::Balloon</tt>. Widgets can be
<tt>attache()</tt>d to the <tt>Tk::ContextHelp</tt> object. To
attach a widget to a section in the Pod file, use the <tt>-pod</tt>
option. The argument should be a regular expression matching
text in the pod, e.g. the section header. For example, to jump to the
foo widget section, you have to write:
<pre>    $contexthelp->attach($widget, -pod => '^\s*FOO WIDGET');</pre>
and the corresponding Pod section will look like:
<pre>=head2 FOO WIDGET</pre>.

<p>
There are two methods <tt>activate</tt> and <tt>deactivate</tt>, to
turn the help system on and off. The module has also a method for
creating a convenience button for turning the help system on/off. To
use this button, write:
<pre>    $contexthelp->HelpButton($top)->pack;</pre>

<p>

This was a short introduction to some help facilities in Perl/Tk. Of
course, you should consult the manual pages for detailed information.
You can also think of other ways to display the documentation, e.g.
using a native Perl/Tk WWW browser (at CPAN, there is
<tt>Tk::Web</tt>).

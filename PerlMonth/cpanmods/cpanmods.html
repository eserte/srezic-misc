<h1>Additional Perl/Tk modules at CPAN</h1>

There are a lot of widgets in the standard Perl/Tk distribution (more
than in the original Tcl/Tk distribution), but you want probably
another widgets - because additional functionality is needed, or a
different look, or ... The widget set in Perl/Tk is not static, the
800.015 distribution has two new widgets in the core: Tk::ProgressBar
(a widget to display a bar meter to show the progress of an operation)
and Tk::Pane (a frame which allows scrollbars, in contrast to the
standard Tk::Frame widget).

<h2>CPAN</h2>

At <a href="http://www.cpan.org">CPAN</a>, the Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network, you can find additional Perl modules, and also
additional modules related to <a
href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Tk">Tk</a>. To install one
of these modules, there is the standard procedure:
<ul>
<li>Fetch the distribution package
<li>Unpack the package. On Unix, you would say
<pre>zcat Tk-Foo-0.01.tar.gz | tar xfv -</pre>
<li>Compile the module. Mostly, there is no real compile, but there
are some modules containing a C part, thus requires a compiler there.
Other, perl-only packages, need this step, too:
<pre>cd Tk-Foo
perl Makefile.PL
make</pre>
<li>Test the module
<pre>make test</pre>
<li>Finally install it
<pre>make install</pre>
</ul>

<p>

There is another way, using the CPAN.pm module, which would do almost
everything automatically: fetch the distribution package and its
dependencies, make, test and install. To use this module, first type:
<pre>perl -MCPAN -e shell</pre>
If this is the first call to the CPAN.pm, you will answer a couple of
questions. After that, you are in the interactive mode. Now type
<pre>install Tk-Foo</pre> and the module will take all steps to
install the module properly. If you want to just see what Tk-related
modules exist, just type
<pre>m /^Tk::/</pre> for a complete list. This will also include the
core Perl/Tk modules.

<p>

For Windows folks, this is inconvenient, because there is often no
compiler and no make installed. If you have Visual C++ and you are
using the <a href="http://www.activestate.com">Activestate Perl</a>,
everything is fine - just use "nmake" instead of "make", and all
things should work. Otherwise you want probably to install gcc for
windows. There is cygwin (link) and mingw32 (link). Note that it is
necessary to compile Perl and Tk with the same compiler as the other
modules. mingw32 uses "dmake" instead of "make".

<p>

An easier way is using the "ppm" install program that comes with
Activestate Perl. It's similar to the CPAN.pm module, instead it
installs precompiles binaries, thus skipping the compiler stage. The
drawback is, that Activestate only provides a limited number of perl
modules as pre-compiled binaries. You don't have access to the
cutting-bleeding-edge modules (totally new ones or just new versions).
Furthermore, the "ppm" program has some disadvantages like not working
properly behind firewalls. If so, you can grab the packages from <a
href="http://www.activestate.com/packages/zips/">http://www.activestate.com/packages/zips</a>
with a common browser and put the package in your local repository
(which one? where?).

<h2>Special Entries</h2>

Good, Entries are there to receive typed text - but sometimes it is
necessary to control what kind of text is typed in. You want probably
restrict the input to a character set, probably to numbers only, or to
limit the size of the text. Or maybe something fancier?

<p>

To get control over the Entry widget, you have to create a new widget,
which inherits from the Entry widget. <a href="MyEntry.pm">Here</a> is
an example for this. This module creates a new widget MyEntry, which
overrides the Insert method. There are some restriction examples in
this module. The forth-coming release 800.017 will have new options
(-validate, -validatecommand) to simplify this task.

<h3>Tk::NumEntry</h3>

But now to the fancy extensions. The NumEntry widget in the Tk-GBARR
distribution (link) will let you restrict the input to digits only.
Additionally you can scroll the current value either with the cursor
keys or with two arrow keys. There are two flavours of this widget:
NumEntryPlain and NumEntry. The first one comes without arrow buttons,
and the second one uses the FireButton widget (which is also part of
this distribution) for the arrow buttons. You can restrict the input
further by specifying minimal and maximal values (-minvalue and
-maxvalue) and the speed of the "scrolling" (-repeatdelay and
-repeatinterval). see manpage and examples.

<h3>Tk::HistEntry</h3>

This is an entry remembering its former values in a history list. You
can change to older values using the cursor up key, just like in
readline-enabled applications like bash and tcsh. Additionally, it's
possible to show the old entries in a pop-up listbox. To store a value
in the history list, the addHistory method has to be called if
appropriate (e.g. when pressing Return in the Entry or by clicking on
a OK button). This module can be found in the Tk-HistEntry
distribution.

<h2>Photo extensions</h2>

Core Perl/Tk has support for the image formats BMP, GIF, XPM, XBM and
PPM. There are additional module for some other image formats:
Tk::JPEG, TK::PNG and Tk::TIFF. Tk::JPEG contains a complete
distribution with the Perl and C code and the code for the whole jpeg
library. The other two modules require to have (probably shared)
libraries installed: zlib and libpng for Tk::PNG, and libtiff for
Tk::TIFF.

<p>

To use the new image formats, one have only to say<pre>use
Tk::JPEG;</pre>. The new image handler is automatically installed and
will be used when reading or writing a jpeg image.

<h1>File dialogs</h1>

This month's article will deal with the ability of Perl/Tk to select
files and directories. It seems to be state of the art that selecting
files is not done within a mere entry widget, but rather with compound
widgets showing available files and directories, possible in a tree
structure.

<h2>getOpenFile/getSaveFile</h2>

<img src="getopenfile.png"><p>

The standard methods in Perl/Tk for displaying file dialogs are
<tt>getOpenFile</tt> (for opening existing files) and
<tt>getSaveFile</tt> (for selecting a name for a non-existing file).
These methods will use - if possible - a native interface. That is, on
Windows the standard file dialog and on Macintosh (if there will be
ever a port of Perl/Tk for the Mac) too. In Unix/X11, there is no
standard file dialog (note that Tk is built on top of Xlib, so KDE/Qt,
CDE/Motif and GNOME/Gtk widgets are not available). In this case, the
dialog is a mega widget written in Perl (which, as shown below, can
also be used for other platforms).

<p>

<tt>getOpenFile</tt>/<tt>getSaveFile</tt> is easy to use: just say

<pre> $top->getOpenFile;</pre>

or

<pre> $top->getSaveFile;</pre>

The execution of the program will stop at this point and a file dialog
will be displayed. After selecting Open/Save or Cancel, the method
call will return the selected file name or an empty string.

<p>

There are a couple of extra options which are described in the
<tt>Tk::getOpenFile</tt> manual page. An example script using more
options can be found <a href="getopenfile.pl">here</a>. The
<tt>-filetypes</tt> option can be used to specify a number of filters
(e.g. show only perl files with the file extension .pl). These filters
are displayed in an option menu widget. It is good practice to always
include an entry "All files", which matches every file in the current
directory. The first entry in the <tt>-filetypes</tt> argument is the
default entry. If <tt>-filetypes</tt> is omitted, the file dialog will
show every file.

<p>

The Windows user is usually familiar with the use of the standard file
dialog. Using the X11 file dialog is quite similar. There is an
additional feature which is especially useful in mouse-less usage. By
switching the focus to the icon list (this is done by hitting
Shift-Tab once), it is possible to type the wanted file name. While
typing, the selection moves to match an appropriate file name. Hitting
return will accept the active selection as the return value of the
dialog.

<h2>Tk::FileSelect</h2>

<img src="fileselect.png"><p>

Back in the old Tk 400.xxx days, there was only the
<tt>Tk::FileSelect</tt> widget available. It's still in the newer
Perl/Tk distributions, and it has some limitations, but also its
advantages.

<p>

First, <a href="fileselect.pl">here</a> is an example for the usage of
the FileSelect dialog. This example shows one of the advantages of
this widget: you can change the names of the labels, which make it
more suitable for internationalisation (in the example the labels were
changed to carry german names). The set of label options is not
complete (yet), but will hopefully in the future.

<p>

You can also specify a <tt>-verify</tt> option to check if the
selected file meets your specifications. The argument is a list of the
standard perl file tests (like ['-r', '-T'], to restrict to readable
text files). This option can also be used to restrict FileSelect to
"DirSelect", by changing the verify option to ['-d'] (here is an <a
href="fileselectdir.pl">example</a>). I will discuss later another way
for selecting directories.

<p>

The options of <tt>Tk::FileSelect</tt> are poorly documented, so here
is a short overview of possible options:
<ul>
<li>-directory: the directory which will be displayed at start
<li>-initialfile: the initially selected file
<li>-filter: only the matching files will be shown (pattern is a shell
glob)
<li>-filelabel, -filelistlabel, -dirlabel, -dirlistlabel: change the
labels for i18n
<li>-verify: see above
<li>-width/-height: the dimension of the directory and file listboxes
</ul>

The forthcoming versions of <tt>Tk::FileSelect</tt> will contain
<tt>-command</tt> and <tt>-transient</tt> options to enable non-dialog
use of the widget.

<p>

Note that <tt>Tk::FileSelect</tt> is partially broken in the newer
Tk's (that is the beta ones: from 800.016 to 800.018), but this will
change in the next releases.

<p>

If you want to use <tt>Tk::FileSelect</tt> as the default file dialog,
then you can say

<pre>    use Tk::FileSelect 'as_default';</pre>

This will cause to change the
<tt>getOpenFile</tt>/<tt>getSaveFile</tt> methods to use the
FileSelect widget from now on.


<h2>Tk::Dirlist</h2>

<img src="dirlist.png"><p>

A lesser known widget in the Perl/Tk distribution is
<tt>Tk::Dirlist</tt>. It's a widget displaying a tree of directories
and files, beginning from the root to a specified directory (or the
current directory). This widget is not a dialog, so you have to do the
packing (or gridding) yourself. It also has no bindings to user
interaction, but since the widget is derived from <tt>Tk::HList</tt>,
the <tt>-command</tt> and <tt>-browsecmd</tt> options can be used. <a
href="dirlist.pl">Here</a> is a short but complete example for the use
of Tk::Dirlist.

<h2>Tk::FBox</h2>

It is also possible to use <tt>Tk::FBox</tt>, which is the widget
serving <tt>getOpenFile</tt> and <tt>getSaveFile</tt> behind the
scenes. <tt>Tk::FBox</tt> can be configured with all the options
<tt>getOpenFile</tt> takes and the additional option <tt>-type</tt>,
which should be either <tt>open</tt> or <tt>save</tt>. After creating
the widget, it can be shown with the <tt>Show</tt> method, as nearly
every Perl/Tk dialog. Using <tt>Tk::FBox</tt> directly is probably
useless on X11, but another file dialog alternative on Win32. <a
href="fbox.pl">Here</a> is an example usage of <tt>Tk::FBox</tt>.

<h2>Dialog for directories: Tk::DirTree</h2>

<img src="dirtree.png"><p>

One way for selecting directories was already discussed (the -d verify
option of <tt>Tk::FileSelect</tt>). In the Perl/Tk distribution, there
is another widget specifically dealing with directories:
<tt>Tk::DirTree</tt>. This widget is not a dialog, so you have to
create a toplevel window and embed this widget in it, and also use
<tt>waitVariable</tt> to block execution until the user made a choice
(Note: <tt>waitVariable</tt> waits until the referenced variable
changes its value. While waiting, the event mechanism of Tk is not
blocked, so you can click on other buttons etc.). In the <a
href="dirtree.pl">example script</a> this usage is demonstrated. The
widget is configured to change the directory with a single click and
to select a directory with a double click (or by clicking the Ok
button which will use the last selected directory). If you don't like
this behaviour, you can easily change the code so that double-clicks
open the selected directory, and the Ok button is the only way to
confirm a selection. This is also described in the sample script.

<h2>More on CPAN</h2>

If you're still not satisfied with these alternatives, there are more
choices on CPAN: <tt>Tk::FileDialog</tt>, which, by author's taste,
looks nicer than <tt>Tk::FileSelect</tt> and <tt>Tk::SelFile</tt>.
The <tt>Tk:FileEntry</tt> widget is a combination of an entry with a
button, which pops up a file dialog on request (this is similar to the
HTTP upload button in HTML forms, as it is used in the Netscape
browser).

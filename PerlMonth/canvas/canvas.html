<h1>The Canvas Widget</h1>

If somebody asks how to do a special thing with a Listbox, I advice
them to use the HList widget. If there are demands for more
complicated things, I would route them for the Canvas widget. You can
probably do everything with the Canvas widget <tt>:-)</tt>

<p>

In drawing applications, there are two philosophies: there are the
pixel-oriented applications like The Gimp or Photoshop, and there are
vector-oriented ones, like xfig or Visio. The low-level drawing
functions of graphic subsystems like the Windows GDI or X11 graphic
primitives are using the first philosophy: you create a backing-store
(in X11: a pixmap) and create lines, rectangles, circles, text in this
backing-store. After creating the items, all information about them is
lost: you can't resize a line easily or remove a filles circle and
leaving all other items intact.

<p>

This is different in the vector-oriented philosophy. All information
about created items is retained. So it's easy to remove or
re-configure items after creation. It's even possible to identify
items for event handling. Perl/Tk's Canvas widget uses the latter
philosophy. In this article I will give a short introduction to this
widget - it's too powerful to be fully described in these few lines.

<h2>Creation</h2>

Creating a canvas widget is straight forward:

<pre>  use Tk;
  $top = new MainWindow;
  $canvas = $top->Canvas->pack;</pre>

This will create an empty canvas widget with the default dimensions
10cm&nbsp;x&nbsp;7cm (these numbers are only correct if the resolution
of the X server is right, check the xdpyinfo(1) and X(1) manpages).
Unlike most other Tk widgets, the Canvas widget does not resize itself
if the its content requests a resize. You have to provide explicit
values for the width and height:

<pre>  $canvas->configure(-width => 640, -height => 480);</pre>

This is only the size of the visible part of the canvas. The internal
useable area is larger, in fact, it's unlimited, although you should
not use items whose size exceeds 32767 pixels. To access the unvisible
parts of the canvas, look below for the -scrollregion discussion.

<h2>Items</h2>

Now to the "vector-oriented" stuff, that is: how to draw something on
the widget? In the following I will give a short description of the
available items. For exact description of all available configuration
options, refer to the Tk::Canvas manpage.

<p>

There are line, text, rectangle, polygon, arc, oval, bitmap, image and
window items. All items are created by a similar method set:

<pre>  $canvas->create<i>Itemtype</i>(<i>coordinates</i>, <i>configure options</i>);</pre>

To create a line beginning at (10,20) and ending at (40,50) with the
default style use:

<pre>  $canvas->createLine(10,20,40,50);</pre>

Note that the origin of the canvas is located in the upper left
corner. Some item types, like texts or images, accept only one
coordinate pair. Other, like the line item, require at least two
coordinate pairs (there is no upper limit).
<p>
Configure options are appended after the coordinates, e.g. to set the
width of the outline of a rectangle to 3 pixels:

<pre>  $canvas->createRectangle(10,10,50,50, -width => 3);</pre>

Most possible configure options are common for several item types.
Here is a list of some of them:

<ul>
<li><tt>-fill => $color</tt>: This option will fill the item region for item
types like rectangle, polygon, arc and oval. For others, it will set
the foreground color. For the color, you can use either X11 color
names (like "red" or "gray50") or the standard "#rrggbb" notation. To
"unfill" a region, the color have to be set to undef.

<li><tt>-outline => $color</tt>: This option only applies to item types, which
have a fill region and a boundary. With -outline, the color of this
boundary can be changed. By default, the outline is black while the
region is unfilles.

<li><tt>-stipple => $stipple</tt>: XXX

<li><tt>-width => $width</tt>: For outlines and lines, this option
specifies the width in pixels. By default, outlines have a width of
one pixel.

<li><tt>-anchor => $direction</tt>: Texts and images are by default
centered to the given coordinate. It is probably common to set the
upper left corner of the text or image to the given coordinate, if you
want to do so, you have to set -anchor to "nw" (northwest).

<li><tt>-tags => $tag</tt>: The argument to this option is either a
string or a reference to a list of strings. With tags items can be
grouped together.
</ul>

The return value of the create method is the id of the created item.
This id can be used to change attributed of the item afterwards, or to
identify an item in an event.
<p>
Almost everywhere ids can be used, tags can also be used. This is
useful to change the attributes of a group of items, or to bind an
event to them.
<p>
To change the attributes of an item, the itemconfigure method can be
used.

<p>
There are two special tags: "current" and "all". The "current" tag
specifies the current item in an event callback. "all" specifies all
canvas items and can be used to bind an event to all items. For
example, to clear the canvas, one can use:
<pre>  $canvas->delete("all");</pre>
<p>
In the (not yet stable) newer versions of Tk (since 800.016), the dash
patches by Jan Nijtmans are incorporated to the Canvas widget. This
adds some additional features, like boolean search (the find method
will be described in a later article) and additional options for the
canvas items.
<p>
It is possible to create new canvas item types, but you have to do so
in C. In the beta versions of Tk, there are two new canvas item types
introduced: grid items and group items. With grid items, a (probably
dashed) grid can be put onto the canvas. This grid has no limits, it
covers the whole canvas. Group items are yet quite experimental; they
are meant to be a means to group items together by not using the tags
option. Grouped items can be, for example, moved by moving the master
group item.

build on top of a checkbutton, printing, find, scale, raise/lower)

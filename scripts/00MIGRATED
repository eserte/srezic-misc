org-daemon

    Now available as a proper CPAN module: App::orgdaemon. Install it
    with one of the following methods:

        cpan App::orgdaemon
        cpanp App::orgdaemon
        cpanm App::orgdaemon

    The repository is available on github:
    https://github.com/eserte/org-daemon

    It's also possible to just clone the repository and use the
    script uninstalled (provided Tk for Perl is already installed):

        git clone https://github.com/eserte/org-daemon.git
        ./org-daemon/bin/org-daemon /path/to/TODO.org &
